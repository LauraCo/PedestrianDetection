# PedestrianDetection

To compliment Aberystwyth University assignment for module CS34110: Could Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) person detection be useful in self-driving cars?

Screenshots will be produced from this implementation to include in my report.

Implementation of HOG descriptor adapted from OpenCV peopledetect.py

Thank you to Charles Newey (https://github.com/charlienewey) for video clips to run pedestrian detection on
